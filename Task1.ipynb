    "# Identification Task \n",

    "## What we need\n",
    "\n",
    "We need a function called check_msm_identification that it easy to use and performs the identification check described in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.13093.pdf). The different variants (e.g. different methods of sampling uniformly from likelihood level sets) can be selected via the optional arguments of check_ml_identification.  The output will either be a dictionary (if it is a small set of outputs that every user will want) or a results object similar to the result of estimate_ml (if there are many different test statistics).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Task 1: Planning\n",
    "\n",
    "- Write down which model specific inputs a user has to supply in order to do an identification check. The names should be aligned with estimate_ml where possible. It will definitely be a likelihood function and a result of estimate_msm but there might be more. \n",
    "- Write down which kinds of outputs a user will get, what they mean and how they should be visualized in a paper (plots, tables, ...). \n",
    "- Write docstrings for check_ml_identification before you actually implement it\n",
    "- Adjust our [simple example](https://estimagic.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/estimation/first_msm_estimation_with_estimagic.html) such that it has a second variable that can be arbitrarily correlated with x (i.e. add an identification problem)\n",
    "- Start to write a tutorial in a notebook that shows how the new function will be used and what the outputs mean\n",
    "\n",
    "## Remarks\n",
    "\n",
    "- You can for now assume that the model parameters (params) are a 1d numpy array. We talk about making this more flexible later. \n",
    "- The idea behind writing the documentation first is that it lets you focus completely on a user friendly interface and a high level understanding. Also, we will probably ask for changes after you show us your proposed interface. If you had already implemented it, you would have to change it."
